Is 26% proficiency in math acceptable to you?  That's the question teacher and Synergy Academies Founder Dr. Randy Palisoc asks the TEDxManhattanBeach audience.  With only 26% of U.S. twelfth graders proficient in mathematics, Randy shares his solution: teach math as a language. Putting words back into math lessons enables even the youngest school-age minds to grasp complex concepts, such as fractions, that are traditionally thought of as abstract and difficult to understand.  In his stunningly simple and effective approach, math no longer creates problems for kids but solves them.\\n\\nRandy Palisoc is a passionate educator, known for making math easy.  A founder of the five-time national award winning Synergy Academies, Randy is proud to identify Synergy as an “in spite of” school.  In spite of the fact that its students were disadvantaged and in spite of the fact that it did not have its own facility and had to pack up its classrooms every single week, his school was the first and only elementary school in South Los Angeles to ever win the National Blue Ribbon Award, and was named the #1 Urban Elementary School in America in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeking a broader impact, Randy left Synergy this year to start Ironbox Education.  One of the ways he believes we can dramatically improve America’s schools is by doing a better job teaching math to our students in a way that makes sense to them.  Randy believes implementing a few changes in the way we approach math will give students the confidence and thinking skills to be more competitive in a global economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFavorite TED Talk:  “My Invention That Made Peace With Lions”: Richard Turere\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “Game Changer” he most admires is Steve Jobs, because he had the ability to envision things we did not even know we needed or wanted.\\r\\n\\n\\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

Откуда они берутся и что с ними делать | Жаксылык Сабитов | TEDxAstana', 'description': 'Жаксылык Сабитов — историк-медиевист. Как историку ему часто приходится сталкиваться с историческими мифами: «Чингиз-хан — казах», «Настоящие казахи – голубоглазые блондины» и так далее. Профессиональному историку разоблачить эти мифы нетрудно, но обыватели с охотой в них верят.\\nЖаксылык считает, что мифы отражают запросы общества и касаются прежде всего тех эпох, которые слабо изучены. Проблемы исторической науки в Казахстане не дают заполнить эти лакуны, из-за чего появляются новые мифы. Среди этих проблем отсутствие научных дискуссий, слабая работа с первоисточниками, отсутствие специалистов и непрестижность профессии историка. \\n«С развитием исторической науки мифы станут более приближенными к исторической реальности и, возможно, менее взрывоопасными и токсичными», — уверен ученый. \\n\\nЖақсылық Сәбитов – ортағасыр тарихшысы. Ол өз қызметі аясында «Шыңғыс хан – қазақ», «Нағыз қазақ – көк көзді аққұбалар» деген сарындағы тарихи мифтерге жиі ұшырасады. Кәсіби тарихшыға бұл аңыздардың ақ-қарасын ажырату қиын емес, десе де адамдар оған сенгісі кеп тұра береді.\\nЖақсылық мифтер қоғамдағы қажеттіліктерді көрсететінін және көбіне аз зерттелген дәуірлерден бастау алатынын алға тартады. Қазақстандағы тарих ғылымының мәселелері бұл олқылықтардың орнын толтыруға мүмкіндік бермейді, сондықтан жаңа мифтер пайда бола бермек. Мәселелер көзі ғылыми талқылаулардың аздығы мен, негізгі дереккөздермен жұмыстың нашарлығында, мамандардың аздығы мен қоғамда тарихшының беделі болмауында жатыр.\\n«Тарих ғылым ретінде дамыған сайын мифтер тарихи шындық шеңберінен шықпайтын болады. Әсері мен ықпалы да төмендей түседі» деген сенімде ғалым. Жаксылык Сабитов\\nИсторик-медиевист\\nЖаксылык – известный историк, чей индекс Хирша – 8 и который входит в топ-3 казахстанских историка по наукометрическим базам данных. По роду своей деятельности Жаксылык постоянно сталкивается с различными историческими мифами, которые широко распространены в нашем обществе. Ему разоблачить их нетрудно, но обыватели с охотой в них верят. Жаксылык считает, что мифы отражают запросы общества и касаются прежде всего тех эпох, которые слабо изучены.

Оларды жоққа шығару тарихшы үшін еш қиын емес, алайда адамдар мұндай ақпаратқа бәрібір сенгісі келіп тұрады. Жақсылық мифтер қоғамның қажеттіліктерін көрсететінін және көбіне аз зерттелген дәуірлерге қатысты екенін алға тартады. Оны зерттеу арқылы тарих ғылымын ілгерілетуге болады.

What if we appreciated the bravery of those who are fighting mental illness every day?

She has struggled with several forms of mental illness— including depression and anxiety— and hopes to use what she has learned from those struggles to help other college students and young adults.
